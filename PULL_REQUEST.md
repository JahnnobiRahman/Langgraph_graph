# Add RAG Agent Implementation and Documentation

## Overview
This pull request introduces a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent implementation along with supporting components for document management and conversational memory.

## Changes Included

### New Features
- 🔍 **RAG Agent Implementation**
  - Chroma vector store integration for efficient document retrieval
  - OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
  - MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) search for diverse results

- 📝 **Document Management**
  - Document drafting capabilities
  - Content persistence and versioning
  - Interactive collaboration features

- 🧠 **Memory Management**
  - Conversational context preservation
  - State tracking across interactions
  - History management

### Documentation
- 📚 Updated README with detailed component descriptions
- 🔧 Setup instructions and dependencies
- 📋 Usage examples and folder structure

## Technical Details
- Implemented using LangChain and LangGraph frameworks
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration for advanced language understanding
- Chroma vector store for efficient document retrieval
- Python-based implementation with proper error handling

## Testing
- All components have been tested locally
- Vector store operations verified
- Memory management tested across multiple interactions

## Dependencies Added
- langchain
- langgraph
- chromadb
- openai
- python-dotenv

## Setup Required
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY)
3. Configure Chroma vector store directory

## Future Improvements
- Add more sophisticated document versioning
- Implement additional retrieval strategies
