# ðŸ§  LangGraph Practice Project

This project demonstrates a collection of mini graph-based workflows using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). Each graph illustrates a different logic pattern â€” from simple greeting flows to conditional branching and looping with state tracking â€” perfect for learning stateful program design.
