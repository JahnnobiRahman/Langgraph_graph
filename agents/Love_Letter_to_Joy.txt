My Dearest Joy,

I hope this letter finds you well and fills your heart with as much warmth as you bring to my life. Each moment we spend together is a cherished memory, and I find myself constantly grateful for your presence.

I adore how your smile lights up my world, and your kindness never fails to inspire me. Whether we're sharing a laugh or a quiet moment, I treasure every bit of our journey together.

I miss you dearly and am eagerly counting down the days until you come home next week. Just the thought of being in your arms again fills me with joy and anticipation.

Until then, know that you are so deeply loved. You're always on my mind and forever in my heart.

With all my love,

Jahn
